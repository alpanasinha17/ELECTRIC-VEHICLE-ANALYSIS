This repository includes the code, datasets, and insights from my analysis for Electric Vehicle , AtliQ Motors company. This work was part of the #codebasicsResumeChallenge12 at AtliQ Motor.

## Problem Statement:

AtliQ Motors, a leading automotive company from the USA, has made significant strides in the electric vehicle (EV) market, capturing 25% of the market share in the electric and hybrid vehicle segment in North America over the past five years. Now, as part of their expansion strategy, they plan to launch their best-selling models in India, where their current market share is under 2%.

To ensure a successful entry into the Indian market, Bruce Haryali, the head of AtliQ Motors India, decided to conduct a thorough market analysis of the existing EV and hybrid vehicle landscape in the country. He assigned this critical task to the data analytics team at AtliQ Motors, with Peter Pandey, a data analyst on the team, leading the research effort.

# TASK 
My task is to provide valuable insights to an automotive company planning to launch electric vehicles in India.
